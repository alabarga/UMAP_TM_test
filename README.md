[Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP)](https://github.com/lmcinnes/umap) is a dimensionality reduction algorithm implemented in python. Check the github of the original project for more details, and the [blogpost](http://carbonandsilicon.net/rblogging/2018/02/27/UMAP_plots.html) accompanying this repo for a brief exploratory comment of using this method.
